# MyVerilogSim

MyVerilogSim is a lightweight educational simulator for the Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL).  
It provides a minimal yet functional environment to parse and execute simple Verilog modules,  
with the goal of helping students and developers understand the basics of hardware simulation  
without the complexity of full-featured tools.

## Features
- Simple and clean design focused on core Verilog concepts  
- Execution of basic Verilog constructs and logic  
- Intended as a learning tool or a foundation for more advanced simulators  

## Goals
This project is not a replacement for professional simulators (like Verilator or ModelSim),  
but rather a minimal framework to demonstrate how a Verilog simulation engine works internally.
